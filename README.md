<p align="center">In this simulation you will be able to see what would happen in different scenarios that you can choose in terms of orbits and planets</p>
<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When you enter the webpage that is linked below you will see an arrow on the top of the page, when clicked a menu with three buttons will drop.
<br/><br/>
The first one will allow you to create planets by setting its name, initial position, initial velocity, mass, radius, color, if you want it to move and if you want it to be followed by the camera, keep in mind that two planets can't have the same name and the color has to be a valid hexadecimal color.
<br/><br/>
The second one will display a list of the current planet names, a cross in case you want to delete them and some properties that you can change.
<br/><br/>
The third and last one allows you to change some system properties such as the gravitational constant, activate or deactivate a velocity limit, change the value of the velocity limit and activate or deactivate collisions. Enabling collisions may have a stronger impact on performance that's why it's disabled by default, if you enable collisions I recommend you to disable the velocity limit because it was added for when collisions are disabled so it cannot cause errors.
<br/><br/>
Also if you are trying this on a computer you will be able to click wherever you want to spawn a planet and drag your cursor to set it's initial velocity, a random planet with a random name will appear at the moment you release your click.</p>
